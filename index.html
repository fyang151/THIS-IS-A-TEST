      <h3>This site is designed as a free database for all CRT essays pertaining to specific novels. Unfortunately, there is a password required to access this site because my school administration is afraid of me getting plagiarized. So try not to blatantly cheat off of this.</h3>
      <h1>Why is this website bad?</h1>
      <h3>Im sorry</h3>
      <h1>How can I contact you?</h1>
      <h3>fyang151@gmail.com</h3>
      <h1>Why are the number of CRT's in this website so sparse?</h1>
      <h3>For a CRT to be considered, it must receive a grade of 90+</h3> 
      <h1>Why do the CRTs sometimes not load when I am accessing this website on mobile?</h1>
